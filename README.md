This is a boilerplate to build stuff on graphs.

It's graphology (javascript library) running on typescript with sigma.js for visualisation.
Already set up with client-server infrastructure to edit and visualise the graph.

## Server (editing)
npm run server

## Client (visualisation, needs server running)
npm run client
