This is a boilerplate to build stuff on graphs.

It's graphology (javascript library) running on typescript with sigma.js for visualisation.
Already set up with client-server infrastructure to edit and visualise the graph.

Usage

```
git clone https://github.com/SolbiatiAlessandro/graphology_typescript_boilerplate
npm install
npm run server # now you can manipulate the graph that is being stored in your local filesystem
npm run client # now you can visualise your graph in the browser
```

## Server (editing)
npm run server

## Client (visualisation, needs server running)
npm run client
